        <h1>OmniAuth Vimeo</h1>

<p>This is an OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Vimeo. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth Application ID and Secret
on the <a href="https://developer.vimeo.com/apps">Vimeo Applications Page</a>.
You can read more about Vimdeo's oauth over at their <a href="https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/advanced#oauth">developer page</a></p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<p>add the following line to your Gemfile.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'omniauth-vimeo'
</code></pre>

<p>If you finished running bundler and omniauth-vimeo is ready to go, you need to add the following lines to your <code>config/initializers/omniauth.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :vimeo, ENV['VIMEO_KEY'], ENV['VIMEO_SECRET']
end
</code></pre>

<p>You need to replace the VIMEO_KEY and VIMEO_SECRET with your own credentials, you can get them at the Vimeo's developer page as mention above.</p>

<h2>Supported Rubies</h2>

<p>OmniAuth Vimeo is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and Ruby Enterprise Edition.</p>

<h2>Note on Patches/Pull Requests</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fork the project.</li>
<li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.</li>
<li>Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.</li>
<li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)</li>
<li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.</li>
