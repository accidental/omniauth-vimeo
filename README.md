# OmniAuth Vimeo

This is an OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Vimeo. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth Application ID and Secret
on the [Vimeo Applications Page](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps).
You can read more about Vimdeo's oauth over at their [developer page](https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/advanced#oauth)

## Basic Usage

add the following line to your Gemfile.

    gem 'omniauth-vimeo'

If you finished running bundler and omniauth-vimeo is ready to go, you need to add the following lines to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :vimeo, ENV['VIMEO_KEY'], ENV['VIMEO_SECRET']
    end

You need to replace the VIMEO_KEY and VIMEO_SECRET with your own credentials, you can get them at the Vimeo's developer page as mention above.

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth Vimeo is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and Ruby Enterprise Edition.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
